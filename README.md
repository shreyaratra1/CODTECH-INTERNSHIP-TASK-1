# OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT-
# Project- Java Program that act as a Basic Calculator
# Objective- The objective of this project is to build a program that act as a basic calculator. It should prompt the user to enter the two numbers and choose an operation (addition, multiplication, division, subtraction). Then, it should perform the selected operation and display the result to the user.
# 
# Key Objectives:
# User Input: The program takes two numbers (num1 and num2) and an arithmetic operator (op) as input from the user using the Scanner class.
# Arithmetic Operations: Based on the operator provided (+, -, *, /), the program performs the corresponding arithmetic operation:
# Addition (+): Adds num1 and num2.
# Subtraction (-): Subtracts num2 from num1.
# Multiplication (*): Multiplies num1 and num2.
# Division (/): Divides num1 by num2.
# Output: After performing the operation, the program prints the formatted result showing the operation performed and the final result.
# 
# Technologies Used:
# Java Programming Language:
# Java is a widely used programming language known for its platform independence, object-oriented paradigm, and extensive standard library.
# Scanner Class (java.util.Scanner):
# The Scanner class is used to read user input from the console (System.in). It provides methods like nextDouble() and next() to read numeric and string inputs respectively.
# Standard Input and Output Streams (System.in, System.out):
# System.in is used to accept user input from the console.
# System.out is used to display output to the console.
# 
# Output of Task-1
