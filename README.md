# OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT-
# Project- Java Program that act as a Basic Calculator
# Objective- The objective of this project is to build a program that act as a basic calculator. It should prompt the user to enter the two numbers and choose an operation (addition, multiplication, division, subtraction). Then, it should perform the selected operation and display the result to the user.
# 
# Key Objectives:
# User Input: The program takes two numbers (num1 and num2) and an arithmetic operator (op) as input from the user using the Scanner class.
# Arithmetic Operations: Based on the operator provided (+, -, *, /), the program performs the corresponding arithmetic operation:
# Addition (+): Adds num1 and num2.
# Subtraction (-): Subtracts num2 from num1.
# Multiplication (*): Multiplies num1 and num2.
# Division (/): Divides num1 by num2.
# Output: After performing the operation, the program prints the formatted result showing the operation performed and the final result.
# 
# Technologies Used:
# Java Programming Language:
# Java is a widely used programming language known for its platform independence, object-oriented paradigm, and extensive standard library.
# Scanner Class (java.util.Scanner):
# The Scanner class is used to read user input from the console (System.in). It provides methods like nextDouble() and next() to read numeric and string inputs respectively.
# Standard Input and Output Streams (System.in, System.out):
# System.in is used to accept user input from the console.
# System.out is used to display output to the console.
# 
# Output of Task-1

# TASK-2
# OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT-
# Project- Student Grade Tracker 
# Objective-The objective of this project is to build a java program that acts as a Student Grade Tracker and manages Student Grade. The program should allow the user to input grades for different subjets or assignments, calculate the average grade, and display the overall grade along with any additional information(scuh as letter grade or GPA).
#
# Key Objectives:
# The key objective of the StudentGrades program is to allow a user to input grades for various subjects and then perform several operations based on those inputs:
# Adding Grades: The program allows the user to input grades for different subjects until they choose to exit. Each grade input consists of a subject name and a corresponding score.
# Calculating Average Grade: After all grades are inputted, the program calculates the average grade based on the scores entered.
# Determining Letter Grade: Using the calculated average grade, the program determines the corresponding letter grade ('A', 'B', 'C', 'D', or 'F') based on predefined grade ranges.
# Displaying Grades: Finally, the program displays all entered grades, the calculated average grade, and the corresponding letter grade.
#
# Grade Class (static class Grade):
# Represents a single grade entry with fields for subject (String) and score (double).
# StudentGrades Class:
# Constructor (StudentGrades()): Initializes an empty ArrayList to store Grade objects.
# addGrade(String subject, double score): Adds a new Grade object to the grades list with the provided subject and score.
# calculateAverage(): Calculates the average score from all grades stored in grades.
# calculateLetterGrade(double average): Determines and returns the letter grade based on the provided average score.
# displayGrades(): Prints out all grades stored in grades, calculates and prints the average grade, and calculates and prints the corresponding letter grade.
# main(String[] args): The main method where the program execution begins. It uses a Scanner object to read user input for subject names and grades, stores them using addGrade(), and finally displays the results using displayGrades().
#
# Technologies Used:
# Java Standard Library (java.util):
# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):Classes and Objects-The program defines a Grade class as a static nested class within StudentGrades. Each Grade object encapsulates data related to a specific subject and its score.
# Encapsulation: grades ArrayList and its operations (addGrade(), calculateAverage(), calculateLetterGrade(), displayGrades()) are encapsulated within the StudentGrades class, promoting modular and reusable code.
# Control Flow and Logic-Looping and Conditional Statement 
# Console Output:System.out.println
#

# Output of Task-2
